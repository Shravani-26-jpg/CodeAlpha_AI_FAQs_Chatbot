🌟 AI FAQs Chatbot | CodeAlpha Internship – Task 2

The AI FAQs Chatbot is an intelligent question–answering system that responds to frequently asked questions related to Artificial Intelligence (AI). It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and Cosine Similarity to understand user queries and return the most relevant answer.

The project includes a Flask-based backend for processing queries and a modern chat-style frontend UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactive user experience.
